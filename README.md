| 2017-04-14 | 22 | Honey I Blew Up The Atoll | r | Flashed the 21 option. To the top required a good head. |
| 2023-02-01 | 23 | Jack be Nimble | r | Approx. date. Kind of a flash, but I think I tried it some years back. Super soft, but a nice climb. |
| 2023-03-03 | 24 | The Engorger | f | Nice route, probably soft, one harder move as you go over the bulge. |
| 2023-03-03 | 24 | Zoot Alors | r | Had one attemp about a month back. Maybe soft, but a super nice route. |

| 2017-06-10 | 25 | Mt Pleasant Butcher | r | Writing much later: First 7b, took I think 5/6 days, a lot of attempts. Some lovely moves, balance, stength and a techinical-ish top. |
